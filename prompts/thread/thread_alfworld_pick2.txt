I need to perform the following steps:

First, I need to find and take the {obj}. =>You have found and taken the {obj_ID} from the {current_location_ID}.<=

Next, I need to put the {obj_ID} in the {target_location_ID}. =>You have put the {obj_ID} in the {target_location_ID}.<=

likely_location_IDs_for_obj = likely_location_IDs_for_obj[likely_location_IDs_for_obj.index(current_location_ID):]

Now I have to repeat the above steps for the second {obj}.
