Prompt:
I need to perform the following action until I have at least 1 dark oak sign: craft 3 dark oak sign using 6 dark oak planks, 1 stick =>


Response:
#START#
target_item = 'dark oak sign'
target_item_count_total = 1
target_craft_command_result_count = 3
precursor1 = 'dark oak planks'
precursor1_count_command = 6
precursor2 = 'stick'
precursor2_count_command = 1

I first need to determine how many times I need to perform the action.

Since I need at least 1 {target_item} and each action produces 3 {target_item}, The number of times I need to perform the action is ceiling of 1/3, which is 1.

target_craft_command_reps = 1
precursor1_count_total = precursor1_count_command * target_craft_command_reps
precursor1_count_total = precursor2_count_command * target_craft_command_reps

Next, I need to get or craft {precursor1}.

To start, I first need to check if I can get {precursor1_count_total} {precursor1}. =>You cannot get the material.<=

Since I cannot get {precursor1}, I need to craft it.

idx = craft_command_item_list.index(min([x for x in craft_command_item_list if precursor1 in x], key=len))
precursor1 = craft_command_item_list[idx]
precursor1_craft_command = craft_command_list[idx]

To craft {precursor1}, I need to perform the following action until I have at least {precursor1_count_total} {precursor1}: {precursor1_craft_command} =>You have completed the action.<=

Next, I need to get or craft {precursor2}.

To start, I first need to check if I can get {precursor2_count_total} {precursor2}. =>You cannot get the material.<=

Since I cannot get {precursor2}, I need to craft it.

idx = craft_command_item_list.index(min([x for x in craft_command_item_list if precursor2 in x], key=len))
precursor2 = craft_command_item_list[idx]
precursor2_craft_command = craft_command_list[idx]

To craft {precursor2}, I need to perform the following action until I have at least {precursor2_count_total} {precursor2}: {precursor2_craft_command} =>You have completed the action.<=

Finally, I will perform the action 1 time.

execute 1
> craft {target_craft_command_result_count} {target_item} using {precursor1_count_command} {precursor1}, {precursor2_count_command} {precursor2} =>Crafted 3 minecraft:{target_item}.<=

Validate: Since I have executed the action 1 time, my sub-task is complete.

Prompt:
I need to perform the following action until I have at least 2 dark oak fence: craft 1 dark oak fence using 2 stick, 4 dark oak planks =>

I first need to determine how many times I need to perform the action.

Since I need at least 2 {target_item} and each action produces 1 {target_item}, The number of times I need to perform the action is ceiling of 2/1, which is 2.

target_craft_command_reps = 2
precursor1_count_total = precursor1_count_command * target_craft_command_reps
precursor2_count_total = precursor2_count_command * target_craft_command_reps

Next, I need to get or craft {precursor1}.

To start, I first need to check if I can get {precursor1_count_total} {precursor1}. =>You have the material.<=

Since I have {precursor1}, I do not need to craft it.

Next, I need to get or craft {precursor2}.

To start, I first need to check if I can get {precursor2_count_total} {precursor2}. =>You cannot get the material.<=

Since I cannot get {precursor2}, I need to craft it.
